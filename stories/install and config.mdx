  dir: './',
});
 
// Add any custom config to be passed to Jest
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  // Add more setup options before each test is run
  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
 
  testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom',
};
 
// createJestConfig is exported this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js config which is async
